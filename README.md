# Notes on Floral Display Data

See .rmd/html files for detailed analyses

## Two potential papers:
 
  1.	Examine latitudinal clines in parameters of floral display, using a functional trait analysis
  2.	Estimate floral synchrony and assortative mating and their potential consequences for range expansion.

# PAPER 1: Variation in Floral Display

## Background: 

  * We know that selection on flowering time chagnes with latitude, resulting in adaptive clines
  * We know that season length dramatically decreases with latitude, imposing selection on flowering time

## Questions:

  1. Is there genetic variation for floral display (and how much within vs among pop0ulations)?
  2. Are there latitudinal clines in floral display, and are they consistent with adaptive hypotheses above? Specifically, we predict that selection due to variation in season length will produce the following clines:
     * Reduced variance with increasing latitude
     * A shift in Peak flowering from late to early in the south (corresponding to the observed cline in the start of flowering)
     * A shift from a normal distribution in the south to a more negative skew in the north (i.e. a shift towards producing more flowers early vs. late in the season)
     * A shift from more normal or leptokurtic (i.e. more extreme values) in the south to more platykurtotic (fewer extreme values) in the north.
  3. Are conventional measurements (e.g. start, end, duration of flowering) correlated with more detailed metrics (i.e. mean + moments of flowering schedule).

## NOTES:

Notes for further discussion:

> Genetic variation within populations

Replication within seed families is low (<=3). This means we can't measure standing genetic variation within populations. 

We do have similar measurements in field data from QUBS, but:
1. Not exactly the same (bud/flwr/frt inflorescence lengths rather than N receptive flowers)
2. Tricky with co-authorship (many student theses involved, including Chris Eckert)
