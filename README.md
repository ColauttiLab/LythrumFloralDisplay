# Notes on Floral Display Data

See .rmd/html files for detailed analyses

## Two potential papers:
 
  1.	Examine latitudinal clines in parameters of floral display, using a functional trait analysis
  2.	Estimate floral synchrony and assortative mating and their potential consequences for range expansion.



# PAPER 1: Variation in Floral Display

## Background: 

  * We know that selection on flowering time changes with latitude, resulting in adaptive clines
  * We know that season length dramatically decreases with latitude, imposing selection on flowering time

## Hypotheses:

  1. Bet-hedging -- Northern populations have HIGHER variance to spread out risk in marginal environment
  2. Pollinator attraction -- Northern populations have LOWER variance to attract pollinators in a short growing season

## Questions:

  1. Does peak flowering date show the same latitudinal cline as day of first flower?
  2. Are there latitudinal clines in floral display traits? 
  3. How do population-level flowering schedules compare to individual-level?




     * A shift in Peak flowering from late to early in the south (corresponding to the observed cline in the start of flowering)
     
  3. Are conventional measurements (e.g. start, end, duration of flowering) correlated with more detailed metrics (i.e. mean + moments of flowering schedule).

## NOTES:

Notes for further discussion:

> Genetic variation within populations

Replication within seed families is low (<=3). This means we can't measure standing genetic variation within populations. 

We do have similar measurements in field data from QUBS, but:
1. Not exactly the same (bud/flwr/frt inflorescence lengths rather than N receptive flowers)
2. Tricky with co-authorship (many student theses involved, including Chris Eckert)
