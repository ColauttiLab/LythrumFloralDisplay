# Notes on Floral Display Data

See .rmd/html files for detailed analyses

## Two potential papers:
 
  1.	Examine latitudinal clines in parameters of floral display, using a functional trait analysis
  2.	Estimate floral synchrony and assortative mating and their potential consequences for range expansion.

# PAPER 1: Variation in Floral Display

## Premise: 

  * We know that selection on flowering time chagnes with latitude
  * We know that season length dramatically decreases with latitude
  * Hypothesis: selection for condensed flowering time with latitude, due to shorter season length

## Questions:

  1. Is there genetic variation for floral display (and how much within vs among pop0ulations)?
  2. Are there latitudinal clines in floral display, and are they consistent with adaptive hypotheses above?
  3. Are conventional measurements (e.g. start, end, duration of flowering) correlated with more detailed metrics (i.e. mean + moments of flowering schedule).
